# Bank-multiChannel
simulation project
A bank has one teller who can serve customers. Customers are divided into two types,
ordinary and distinguished customers, where each type has a separate queue. The time
between arrivals and the service time for the ordinary customers are as shown in table 1,
while the time between arrivals and the service time for the distinguished customers are
as shown in table 2. The distinguished customers have a higher priority to be served,
i.e., a waiting distinguished customer will be served before a waiting ordinary customer.
However, the service of an ordinary customer cannot be interrupted by the arrival of an
distinguished customer.
